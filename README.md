# BlackJack_Card_Game
This project provides a python implementation of the popular card game BlackJack, also known as 21. The objective of the game is to have a hand value that is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand value, without exceeding 21. In this game, you will play against the computer dealer and have the opportunity to place bets, receive cards, and make strategic decisions to beat the dealer. The game follows standard Blackjack rules, where face cards are worth 10 points, numbered cards are worth their face value, and Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on your choice.  return

The game is designed to be interactive and easy to play. Simply run the Python script, enter the value of chips you want to start with, and follow the prompts to place bets, receive cards, and make decisions. The game will continue until you win, lose, or choose to stop playing.  return
